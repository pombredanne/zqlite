# zarino / zqlite

A SQLite command line client, written in Python, with neat ASCII tables.

Because there's only so much of the native SQLite client that Zarino can take. Chances are you're probably the same.

Pronounced: ZEE-qul-ite

## Requirements

- Python 2.5 or higher (for string format specification language in table.py)
